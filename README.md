# auth-audience

Middleware to support JWT audience role for SakuraApi servers

Include this as a plugin when instantiating `SakuraApi`. For example:
```
  const authAudienceOptions = {
    // see: IAuthAudienceOptions for all your options
  };
  
  const sapi = new SakuraApi({
    // ... other stuff
    plugins: [
      {
        options: authAudienceOptions,
        order: 1,
        plugin: addAuthAudience
      }
    ]
  });
```

# Install
`npm i @sakuraapi/auth-audience`


# Configuration

You'll need to setup your environment (`src/config/environment.ts`, for example) with at least the following:
```
modules.export = {
  authentication: {
    jwt: {
      audience: "audience.somedomain.somewhere",
      issuer: "issuer.somedomain.somewhere",
      key: "12345678901234567890123456789012"
    }
  }
};
```

The `audience` is the identifier for the server on which you are implementing this plugin, it should have also been configured in your `auth-native-authority` or `auth-oauth-authority` settings.

The `issuer` is the identifier of the server that's providing the JWT credentials. 

The key is the shared secret with the issuer. It's a 32 character key. Remember, if your issuer is supporting multiple audience servers, they don't have to share the same private keys -- in fact, you might not want them to.

This shouldn't need to be stated: don't commit your production private keys to your repo. Instead, inject them during deployment. How you do this is beyond the scope of this readme. This, by the way, is why you don't provide your key via the `authOptions` above. By putting it in your config files, you're able to create a config file for production that takes an environmental variable instead of having the key hard coded.

# Use
`auth-audience` exports `AuthAudience`. This can be used on your `@Routable` api calsses.

Some rules to keep in mind:

1. Authenticators are applied from left to right (in terms of their placement in an array).
1. Each route has an array of authenticators that is a defined as `[...route-level-authenticators, ...class-level-authenticators]`.
1. The first authenticator to succeed stops the iteration through authenticators.
1. If all authenticators fail, the first one to have failed dictates the response.
1. Authenticators can be provided alone, or as an array.

## Example 1:
```
@Routable({
    authenticators: [AuthAudience, Anonymous],
    baseUrl: 'someapi'
})
class SomeApi {}
```
(`Anonymous` is an authenticator exported by `@sakuraapi/api`).

Example 1 subjects all `someapi` routes to `AuthAudience`. If that fails, then it subjects the request to `Anonymous` (which will never fail). If `AuthAudience` succeeds, a JWT for the user will be available on `res.locals.jwt` (or wherever you put it if you override `onAuthorized` in your options).

## Example 2:
```
@Routable({
    authenticators: AuthAudience,
    baseUrl: 'someapi'
})
class SomeApi {}
```

Subjects all `someapi` routes to `AuthAudience`, if that fails the user will get a 401 or whatever you set in your options.

## Example 3
```
@Routable({
    baseUrl: 'someapi'
})
class SomeApi {}
```
This just lets everything through.

## Example 4
```
@Routable({
    baseUrl: 'someapi'
})
class SomeApi {
    @Route({
        authenticators: Anonymous
        method: 'get',
        path: 'handler1'
    })
    handler1(res, req, next) {
        next();
    }

    @Route({
        authenticators: AuthAudience
        method: 'get',
        path: 'handler2'
    })
    handler2(res, req, next) {
        next();
    }
}
```
Here, `someapi/handler1` route is Anonymous and will let anyone through. `someapi/handler2` route is subjected to `AuthAudience`.

## Example 5
 ```
 @Routable({
     authenticators: AuthAudience,
     baseUrl: 'someapi'
 })
 class SomeApi {
     @Route({
         authenticators: Anonymous
         method: 'get',
         path: 'handler1'
     })
     handler1(res, req, next) {
         next();
     }
 
     @Route({
         method: 'get',
         path: 'handler2'
     })
     handler2(res, req, next) {
         next();
     }
 }
 ```
In the above example, all routes would be subjected to `AuthAudience`, but `someapi/handler1` would override that and let anyone through as Anonymous.

In this case, route `someapi/handler1` would not have a JWT injected since Anonymous would be executed before `AuthAudience`. Be careful with your ordering.
